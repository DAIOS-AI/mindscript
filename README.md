# MindScript

An experimental programming language combining formal and informal computation.

(C) 2024 DAIOS Technologies Limited

## Description

MindScript is a programming language with both formal and informal
computation as first class citizens. Formal computation is implemented as
a Turing-complete programming language, while informal computation is 
obtained by consulting an oracle, implemented as a large language model.

Features:

- MindScript implements an [oracle machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine).
- Minimal C-like/JavaScript syntax on top of JSON data types.
- Runtime type checking.
- Code comments are semantic type annotations.
- (Current version) implemented in Python.


Applications:

- Processing of unstructured information
- Language model agents
- Semantic web
- and much more.
