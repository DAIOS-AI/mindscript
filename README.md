## Description

MindScript is a programming language which treats both formal and informal
computation as first class citizens. Formal computation is implemented as
a Turing-complete programming language, while informal computation is 
implemented by consulting a large language model representing an oracle.

Features:

- MindScript implements an [oracle machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine).
- Minimal C-like/JavaScript syntax on top of JSON data types.
- Runtime formal type checking.
- Code comments are semantic type annotations.
- (Current version) implemented in Python.


Applications:
- Semantic Web
